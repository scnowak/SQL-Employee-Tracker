## Description
Create interface that allows non-developers to easily view and interact with information stored in databases. These interfaces are called **content management systems (CMS)**. I am building a command-line application from scratch to manage a company's employee database, using Node.js, Inquirer, and MySQL.



## User Story
```
AS A small business owner
I WANT to be able to write and save notes
SO THAT I can organize my thoughts and keep track of tasks I need to complete
```

## Acceptance Criteria
```
GIVEN a note-taking application
WHEN I open the Note Taker
THEN I am presented with a landing page with a link to a notes page
WHEN I click on the link to the notes page
THEN I am presented with a page with existing notes listed in the left-hand column, plus empty fields to enter a new note title and the note’s text in the right-hand column
WHEN I enter a new note title and the note’s text
THEN a "Save Note" button and a "Clear Form" button appear in the navigation at the top of the page
WHEN I click on the Save button
THEN the new note I have entered is saved and appears in the left-hand column with the other existing notes and the buttons in the navigation disappear
WHEN I click on an existing note in the list in the left-hand column
THEN that note appears in the right-hand column and a "New Note" button appears in the navigation
WHEN I click on the "New Note" button in the navigation at the top of the page
THEN I am presented with empty fields to enter a new note title and the note’s text in the right-hand column and the button disappears
```

## Installation & Usage

Type `npm init` in the terminal to get `package.json`.

Type `npm install express` in the terminal to install dependencies for the project.

Open 'Intergrated Terminal' on 'server.js' and key in 'node server.js'

Use the 'UP' and 'DOWN' arrow keys to navigate the command line.

## Heroku Deployed Link
I was unable to use Heroku even after all directions were followed and installation was a success. 

## In Conclusion
I learned how to creating a robust content management systems (CMS).
I learned how to build a command-line application from scratch to manage an employee database, using Node.js, Inquirer, and MySQL.
I created a walkthrough video to show how the interfaces operate and completed the acceptance criteria.
